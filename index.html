        <p class="lead">Secret Santa is a display of community through anonymous gift giving. It's about brightening someone's day whether they can afford something or not, or giving someone a Christmas whose situation otherwise wouldn't allow one. It's display of empathy through gift giving and is emblematic of our responsibility to each other's happiness. Secret Santa isn't about the gifts - it's about the act of compassion.</p>

        <div class="featurette">
        <a name="how"></a>
        <h2 class="featurette-heading">How it all <span class="muted">started</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">Secret Santa  was started From humble beginnings. A few people who got to know each other on Google+ decided to organize a gift exchange between themselves but as they considered all the people they should include they realized it might be bigger than they thought. And so the Secret Santa page was born.</p>

        <div class="featurette">
        <h2 class="featurette-heading">+Secret Santa last <span class="muted">2011</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">Last year Secret Santa collected over 1,000 wishlists, sent over a thousand gifts, and was followed by more than 5,000 people - all on Google+. There were countless stories of someone who donated money to charity, was able to give their children toys, or the community rallying behind a good soul and getting them a gift it they would have never asked for but deserved. </p>
